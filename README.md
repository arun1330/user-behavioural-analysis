# **User Behavioural Analysis in an Autonomous System**

### **Aims:**

  - To develop a robust notification system that alerts admins to DDoS attacks and 
other critical network events in real-time based on the user behaviour.

  - To minimize the impact of DDoS attacks through timely detection and alerting.

### **Objectives:**

  The objective of implementing the DDoS attack notification system in an 
autonomous system based on a user behaviour is to provide real-time alerts to 
administrators about DDoS attacks and critical network events, enabling timely and 
effective responses to mitigate potential disruptions and maintain system integrity.

##### **1. Identify Notification Requirements:**
   
  - Determine the levels of alerts necessary for effective monitoring and response.
  - Establish preferred channels for delivering notifications to the admins.

##### **2. Set Up Monitoring Tools:**

  - Implement network monitoring tools to capture and analyse network traffic.
  - Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect DDoS attacks and other 
threats.

##### **3. Configure Alerting Mechanisms:**

  - Leverage built-in alerting features of monitoring tools and cloud services.
  - Integrate alerting systems with communication platforms like Slack and 
Microsoft Teams.
  - Set up SMS notifications for critical alerts using gateway services.

##### **4. Testing and Validation:**
 
  - Simulate DDoS attacks to test the effectiveness of the notification system.
  - Verify the delivery and formatting of notifications across all chosen channels.
  - Make adjustments based on test results to ensure reliability.

##### **5. Ongoing Maintenance:**

  - Conduct regular reviews of alert configurations and thresholds.
  - Update the system based on network traffic patterns and new threat intelligence.
  - Establish a feedback loop with administrators to continually improve the 
notification system.

### **Methodology:**

##### **1. Requirement Analysis:**
 
  - Conduct discussions with stakeholders to understand the types of alerts needed.
  - Decide on notification channels based on stakeholder preferences and technical 
feasibility.

##### **2. Tool Selection and Deployment:**

  - Choose appropriate network monitoring tools and IDS.
  - Implement cloud-based security services for enhanced protection.

##### **3. Alert Configuration:**

  - Configure built-in alerting features in tools like Cloudflare.
  - Integrate with SMS gateway services like Twilio and Nexmo for critical alerts.

##### **4. Testing and Validation:**
 
  - Use simulation tools to create controlled DDoS attack scenarios.
  - Monitor the systemâ€™s response and ensure notifications are sent and received 
correctly.
  - Iterate on configurations based on feedback from testing.

##### **5. Documentation and Training:**
 
  - Create detailed documentation for the setup and configuration of monitoring 
and alerting tools.
  - Organize training sessions and hands-on workshops for administrators.

##### **6. Maintenance and Improvement:**
 
  - Regularly review and update alert configurations.
  - Collect feedback from administrators and make continuous improvements.

### **Tools to be used:**

#### **1. Monitoring Tools:**
   -  **Wireshark:** For capturing and analyzing network traffic.

#### **2. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**
   -  **Snort:** For real-time network traffic analysis and intrusion detection.

#### **3. Cloud-Based Security Services:**
   -  **Cloudflare:** For DDoS protection and web traffic analysis.

#### **4. Alerting and Notification Tools:**
   -  **Slack Webhooks:** For sending real-time alerts to Slack channels.
   -  **Nexmo:** For SMS gateway services.

#### **5. Custom Scripts:**
   -  **Python:** For scripting custom alerts and notifications.

#### 6. Sample website:
   - To simulate controlled DDoS attack and ensure the working of the system and 
notifiy the admins in case of an attack.
